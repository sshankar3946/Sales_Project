# <ins> OVERVIEW </ins>

This project explores and analyzes sales data from a multi-branch retail business to extract insights related to customer behavior, profitability, operational efficiency, and payment trends.

Using SQL and Excel/Power BI (or Python), I solved 10 real-world business problems that could support decision-making in marketing, sales optimization, and branch performance tracking.

	•	Demonstrate data cleaning, querying, and analytical reasoning
